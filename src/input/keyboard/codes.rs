//! An exhaustive list of Win32 virtual key codes.

/// Virtual Key codes which identify physical keys on a keyboard, in addition to
/// some virtual keys such as mouse buttons.
///
/// Virtual key codes are not the same as the unicode characters which result
/// from keyboard entry. These key codes tell you which physical button was
/// pressed, but should not be used for text input. Virtual key codes are mostly
/// only useful for simple key pressed/released tracking.
///
/// For keyboard state tracking and text input, the [`Keyboard`] object should
/// be used. Every [`Window`] has an associated [`Keyboard`] which can be
/// retrieved via [`Window::keyboard()`].
